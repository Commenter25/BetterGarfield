# Features
This style includes a variety of changes, including:
* A wider page
* Removal of ads*
* Larger games
* Slight increase in aesthetic pleasing
* Some easter eggs hidden
* Hiding some annoying things
* Better list pages (like the games page)
* Fixing a random typo
* Compacting some things
* Commented code for ease of modification
* And definitely more to come!

<sup>_\*ads will still load (unless you have an ad blocker), but they will not be visible and will allow more room for what you actually care about. if you still want to support them but don't want ads in your way, this is a win-win._</sup>
