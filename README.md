You can help this grow! If you think of anything to add to BetterGarfield, from a simple extra option to a crazy idea that would take months, go to the issues page and suggest it!

<sup>_\*ads will still load (unless you have an ad blocker), but they will not be visible and will allow more room for what you actually care about. if you still want to support them but don't want ads in your way, this is a win-win, because it should still count as a "impression"._</sup>  
<sup>📵 - _On a screen smaller than 768px in width, this is likely bugged. Sorry phones._</sup>

# Download
This is only available in the UserCSS format. If you know what that means, then you can move on.  
Rest of you, all you need to know is that you need to use Stylus. Get it [here for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [here for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

After installing, the editor might appear, and you see a bunch of "issues". The code is actually 100% functional, this is a issue with the system for finding bugs. It doesn't understand the exact code being used, and thinks "wait a minute... THAT ISN'T NORMAL REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" Just close the tab and try visting Garfield.com!

The version on userstyles.org is _**not actually BetterGarfield.**_ I only uploaded a fake version there so people can find the style easily. [You can read about why I refuse to post this style there on this page.](https://github.com/CommenterOfComments/CommenterUserstyles/wiki/why-don't-you-like-userstyes.org%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F)

Thanks to The Issues Page®, we can learn what everyone wants from this project, and try to add it!

Due to this, it's advised that if you want something changed, rather than simply modifying your copy and being done, you should (also?) use The Issues Page® to start a discussion about what you don't like about it.

# "How can I help?"
Ah, you have decided to help make BetterGarfield better! Thank you so much!  
However, as of right now, it's ill-advised. A major update is being worked on now.  
It would be wise to wait for the new update to come, and work with that version.  
You may also submit a issue (as told above)
