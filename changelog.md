* Email Garfield page has had its tabs removed (they're redundant clutter)

**Bug fixes:**
  * Listable items pages (games, apps, books, etc) would show the Play/More text when selecting. It'll still copy, but I can't fix that.
  * Actually changed the version number on the style before releasing :p
  * Fixed a typo in the news ticker ("Watch the The Garfield Show on YouTube!")
  * The hover for listable items was 1 pixel off the gradient thingy. I know, I just saved your life, get off your knees.
  * Whoops! I forgot to add the mouse-over-click feature to the characters page!
